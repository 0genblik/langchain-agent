# Open-Source Agent Demo

This repository shows how to build an open-source AI agent using LangChain and Gemini.
It demonstrates:

1. How to define **tools** (search, wiki, retriever).
2. How to design an **agent loop** using Reason-Act-Observe.
3. How to integrate **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.
4. How to apply **guardrails, memory, and structured outputs**.

The goal is to provide a fully free, reproducible reference that can run
on Google Colab or any laptop without paid APIs.

The training examples in this repo describe basic agent patterns,
prompt engineering tips, and safety principles.
